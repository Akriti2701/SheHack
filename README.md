## Problem Statement

During the pandemic era, everyone is at courtesy of social help and this requires a large number of contributions from people. 
But doing this physically is not feasible. Working in CS requires being able to work efficiently in teams. But many students just slack off as they are unable to form/find a team.
Thereâ€™s also lack of social awareness towards nature and how important contributions are, may those be for social good or personal development for a student.
With Alute, we aim at tackling both of these problems with a single solution.
